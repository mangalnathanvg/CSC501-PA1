1) What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies? Also, give the advantages and disadvantages of the round robin scheduling policy originally implemented in Xinu.

Answers: 

    a) XINU Default Scheduler:

        Advantages:
        i)  A process with highest priority will always be executed immediately
        ii) New process is picked in constant time i.e last element in ready queue.

        Disadvantages:
        i)  Starvation Problem: Processes with lower priorities will not get a chance to execute.

    b) Exponential Distribution Scheduler:

        Advantages:
        i)  New process selected based on random value. This eliminates starvation to an extent. Low priority processes have equal chances as high priority process to execute.

        Disadvantages:
        i)  The next process selected cannot be predicted. It is clearly not an effective solution to starvation problem.

    c) Linux-like Scheduler:

        Advantages:
        i) Here processes are selected based on their behaviour in previous epoch. Processes that do not use up all their quantum will have higher goodness value than processes that do.
        ii) Process selection can be easily predicted based on the goodness value.

        Disadvantages:
        i) More resources are exhausted by the system to accomodate calculation and maintenance of goodness and counter values.

2) Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.

Answers:

    a) XINU Default Scheduler: NULL Process will be executed if it is the only process in the ready queue.
    b) Exponential Distribution Scheduler: NULL Process will be executed if it is the only process in the ready queue.
    c) Linux-Like Scheduler: NULL Process will never be scheduled because its goodness value is always zero.
